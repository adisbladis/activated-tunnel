* Socket activated SSH tunnels

** Motivation
I want to use the equivalent of =ssh -L= and =ssh -D= but socket activated.

This project is supposed to run in the context of a systemd unit.
For usage see =activated-tunnel --help=.

** Hacking
#+begin_src sh
go build
systemfd -s 5001 -- ./activated-tunnel
#+end_src
